## Example 1: Santos Net-Zero Litigation (2021-2025)

**Event**: Santos made public claims about being a "clean energy" company and achieving net-zero emissions through carbon capture and nature-based offsets, despite continuing fossil fuel expansion.

**Company**: Santos Ltd (Oil & Gas)

**Year**: 2021 (litigation filed August 2021, expanded August 2022, ongoing)

**ACCR Response**: Filed Federal Court proceedings alleging misleading and deceptive conduct under Corporations Act and Australian Consumer Law. Litigation continues; no final judgment yet but has become first global test case of net-zero claim veracity.

**Outcome**: Case active with court-supervised conferral in Feb 2023. Amendments clarified and reduced dispute issues. Significant media attention and precedent-setting implications for corporate climate claims globally.

**Key Factors**:

- **High moral salience**: Greenwashing threatens Paris alignment, misleads investors/public
- **Severe normative gap**: Claims violated ACCC guidelines, contradicted scientific consensus
- **Engagement exhausted**: Santos unresponsive to prior concerns about climate plan credibility
- **Precedent-setting**: First Australian litigation testing net-zero claims; global significance
- **Systemic implications**: Established accountability standard for all corporate climate disclosures

**Probability Factors**: Moral urgency (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Severe normative gap (+0.30) + Engagement failure (+0.30) + High precedent (+0.25) = 0.85+ (litigation filed)

## Example 2: AGL Demerger Opposition (2022)

**Event**: AGL proposed demerging coal assets into separate entity (Accel Energy) to separate "clean" retail business, which critics argued would worsen climate outcomes by removing accountability and investment discipline from coal operations.

**Company**: AGL Energy (Utilities)

**Year**: 2022

**ACCR Response**: Public campaign materials, coordinated investor opposition with institutional investors and Grok Ventures (billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes), filed public statements opposing demerger structure.

**Outcome**: Demerger abandoned after significant shareholder opposition (>20% against in proxy votes). Board withdrew proposal citing insufficient support. Widely attributed to ACCR, Grok, and 100+ coordinated investors.

**Key Factors**:

- **Strong coalition**: Institutional investors (super funds) + high-profile activist investor + ACCR coordination
- **Climate transition priority**: Demerger would undermine orderly coal phase-out
- **Systemic concern**: Set precedent for other utilities attempting to "spin off" fossil assets
- **Company responsiveness failure**: AGL ignored investor feedback during demerger design

**Probability Factors**: Climate priority (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Strong coalition (+0.25) + Engagement failure (+0.15) = 0.70+ (active opposition)

## Example 3: BHP Climate Lobbying Resolutions (2019)

**Event**: BHP maintained memberships in industry associations (Minerals Council of Australia, Business Council of Australia) that actively lobbied against Paris-aligned climate policy, despite BHP's public climate commitments.

**Company**: BHP Group (Resources/Minerals)

**Year**: 2019

**ACCR Response**: Filed two shareholder resolutions: (1) Ordinary resolution requiring Paris-aligned lobbying disclosure, (2) Special resolution to amend constitution allowing advisory votes on climate.

**Outcome**: Climate lobbying resolution achieved 29.58% support (Sydney AGM), 22.16% (London AGM). Board opposed but BHP subsequently reviewed industry association memberships and increased climate disclosure.

**Key Factors**:

- **Contradictory conduct**: Public Paris support + contradictory lobbying
- **Moderate coalition**: Some investor support but not full institutional backing
- **Normative gap**: Industry association lobbying violated stated climate commitments
- **Systemic issue**: Part of broader campaign on corporate lobbying alignment

**Probability Factors**: Climate priority (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Normative gap (+0.15) + Moderate coalition (+0.10) = 0.70 (resolutions filed)

## Example 4: Qantas Human Rights Resolutions (2018-2019)

**Event**: Qantas provided involuntary transportation services for Australian government deportations of asylum seekers, raising concerns about complicity in human rights violations under UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

**Company**: Qantas Airways

**Years**: 2018 (constitutional + due diligence resolutions), 2019 (enhanced review resolution)

**ACCR Response**:

- **2018**: Filed Resolution 5.1 (constitutional amendment for advisory votes) and 5.2 (human rights due diligence on involuntary transportation)
- **2019**: Filed enhanced human rights review resolution requesting UNGPs-based assessment

**Outcome**:

- **2018**: Resolutions received minority support, established issue visibility
- **2019**: Resolution received 23.56% shareholder supportâ€”largest human rights vote in Australian corporate history at the time
- Qantas continued deportation flights but faced sustained reputational pressure

**Key Factors**:

- **High moral salience**: Harm to vulnerable asylum seekers, UNGPs violation
- **Coalition support**: Co-filed with Refugee Advice & Casework Service (RACS), ethical investors
- **Precedent-setting**: First major shareholder vote on human rights in Australia
- **Company unresponsive**: Qantas refused to engage substantively despite repeated concerns

**Probability Factors**: Human rights priority (0.35) + Precedent (+0.25) + Coalition (+0.25) + Engagement failure (+0.30) = 0.85+ (resolutions filed both years)

## Example 5: Woodside Climate Lobbying (2020-2022)

**Event**: Woodside expanded fossil fuel projects (Scarborough gas, Browse Basin) while maintaining memberships in industry associations lobbying against climate policy, contradicting stated Paris support.

**Company**: Woodside Petroleum Ltd (Oil & Gas)

**Years**: 2020-2022 (multi-year engagement)

**ACCR Response**: Filed climate-related lobbying resolution in 2020; continued engagement and further resolutions on climate strategy and decommissioning responsibility in subsequent years.

**Outcome**: 2020 lobbying resolution achieved 42.66% shareholder support (highest for ACCR climate resolution at time). Woodside made incremental disclosure improvements but continued fossil expansion. ACCR maintained pressure through multi-year campaign.

**Key Factors**:

- **Persistent climate priority**: Core advocacy focus on fossil fuel majors
- **Strong coalition**: International investors + Australian super funds
- **High shareholder support**: >40% demonstrated mainstream investor concern
- **Partial responsiveness**: Some disclosure improvements but no strategic pivot

**Probability Factors**: Climate priority (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Strong coalition (+0.25) + Moderate normative gap (+0.15) = 0.75+ (multi-year engagement)

## Example 6: Origin Energy Governance Resolutions (2019)

**Event**: Origin maintained lobbying inconsistent with Paris Agreement and lacked constitutional provisions for advisory ESG votes, similar to BHP concerns.

**Company**: Origin Energy (Utilities)

**Year**: 2019

**ACCR Response**: Filed special resolution to amend constitution for advisory votes and ordinary resolution requiring Paris-aligned lobbying disclosure.

**Outcome**: Lobbying resolution achieved significant minority support (exact figures in AGM minutes, ~25-30% range). Built credible shareholder pressure following BHP campaign precedent.

**Key Factors**:

- **Climate + governance themes**: Lobbying transparency + procedural reform
- **Coalition support**: Followed successful BHP campaign model
- **Sector relevance**: Utilities transitioning from fossil fuels
- **Moderate normative gap**: Behind sector peers on lobbying disclosure

**Probability Factors**: Climate priority (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Coalition (+0.25) + Moderate gap (+0.15) = 0.70 (resolutions filed)

## Example 7: South32 Supply Chain Research (2018-2019) - NO RESOLUTION FILED

**Event**: Concerns emerged about South32's supply chain human rights practices and carbon disclosure gaps, particularly in mining operations.

**Company**: South32 (Resources)

**Year**: 2018-2019

**ACCR Response**: Conducted research and published investor briefing materials. Communicated findings to company privately. DID NOT escalate to shareholder resolution despite documenting concerns.

**Outcome**: No resolution filed. South32 made incremental public commitments to supply chain transparency improvements following ACCR engagement.

**Key Factors**:

- **Moderate thematic alignment**: Human rights + disclosure, but not egregious violations
- **Company relatively responsive**: Engaged with ACCR concerns, made commitments
- **Limited coalition appetite**: Insufficient investor support for formal resolution
- **Not precedent-setting**: Similar supply chain issues addressed elsewhere

**Probability Factors**: Moderate alignment (0.20) + Responsive company (-0.25) + Weak coalition (-0.20) + Low precedent (0) = 0.20 baseline only (research publication, no resolution)

## Example 8: Santos "Say on Climate" Resolution (2021)

**Event**: Santos lacked credible decarbonisation commitments and Paris-aligned climate strategy despite being major Australian gas producer, prompting shareholder demand for annual climate accountability votes.

**Company**: Santos Ltd (Oil & Gas)

**Year**: 2021

**ACCR Response**: Filed "Say on Climate" shareholder resolution requiring annual disclosure and advisory vote on climate transition plan.

**Outcome**: Resolution received minority but significant support (exact percentage varies by year; generally 40-45% range in Say on Climate votes). Part of broader global Say on Climate movement. Led to eventual litigation when Santos' climate claims deemed misleading.

**Key Factors**:

- **Climate priority**: Core advocacy focus on fossil fuel transition
- **Strategic escalation**: Say on Climate as stepping stone to accountability
- **Coalition support**: Part of international Say on Climate coordination
- **Unsatisfactory prior engagement**: Santos' climate plan lacked credibility
- **Precedent-setting**: Among first Say on Climate votes in Australia

**Probability Factors**: Climate priority (0.35) + Systemic (+0.25) + Coalition (+0.25) + Engagement failure (+0.15) + Precedent (+0.15) = 0.80+ (resolution filed, later escalated to litigation)
