Given a corporate event or governance issue, predict the probability that HESTA will engage in shareholder activism (voting against management, filing resolutions, public advocacy, or divestment escalation) and assess HESTA's sentiment toward the company.

Your prediction must be grounded in:
1. HESTA's documented governance principles and thematic priorities
2. Psychological and behavioral frameworks that govern pension fund activism
3. Historical patterns from similar contexts (provided as few-shot examples)
4. The specific characteristics of the triggering event
