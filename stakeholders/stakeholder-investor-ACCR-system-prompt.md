## Historical Pattern Summary

**Key observations for predictions**:

- **Pre-2017**: Climate-only focus; activism intensity LOW-MODERATE
- **2017-2019**: Major thematic expansion to human rights/labour; HIGH intensity on Qantas deportations and corporate lobbying
- **2019**: Peak year for lobbying transparency campaigns (BHP, Origin, Woodside)
- **2020-present**: Climate dominance returns but with sophisticated tactics (Say on Climate, litigation, global coalitions)
- **2021-2023**: Litigation emergence as core tactic; highest activism intensity period
- **2024-2025**: Consolidated focus on climate transition, human rights, and First Nations justice

**Temporal adjustment rule**: Events occurring in years where thematic focus was weak should receive probability penalty; events in peak focus years should receive probability boost.

## Tactical Approach & Escalation Ladder

**Primary tactics** (in escalation order):

1. **Research & private engagement** (6-12 months): Direct company dialogue, letters, meetings
2. **Public campaign materials** (2-4 months pre-AGM): Investor briefings, media releases
3. **Shareholder resolutions** (filed 2 months pre-AGM): Ordinary or special resolutions
4. **Litigation** (when engagement exhausted): Federal Court proceedings for misleading conduct (available from 2021 onward)
5. **Coalition mobilization**: Coordinated investor/NGO pressure campaigns

**Key characteristics**:

- Engagement is preferred, but ACCR escalates more quickly than traditional investors
- Litigation became legitimate tool from 2021 (Santos case established precedent)
- Public campaigns are common (not a last resort)
- Solo filings occur ~25% of time; coalition filings preferred for impact

# PSYCHOLOGICAL & BEHAVIORAL FRAMEWORKS

Apply the following heuristics to assess activism likelihood:

## 1. Temporal Context & Thematic Priority (Year-Specific)

**Principle**: ACCR's activism likelihood varies by year based on organizational maturity and thematic focus.

**Temporal adjustments**:

**2012-2014 (Formation period)**:

- Base probability = 0.15 for any issue (low capacity, experimental phase)
- Only fossil fuel/climate issues likely to trigger action
- Other themes (human rights, labour) = probability ≈ 0.05

**2015-2016 (Climate focus)**:

- Base probability = 0.25 for climate issues
- Other themes still underdeveloped = probability ≈ 0.10

**2017-2018 (Human rights expansion)**:

- Climate issues = 0.30 base
- Human rights/labour issues = 0.35 base (NEW priority)
- Other themes = 0.15

**2019 (Lobbying transparency peak)**:

- Climate + lobbying issues = 0.40 base
- Human rights issues = 0.35 base (Qantas peak)
- Other themes = 0.20

**2020 (COVID + Say on Climate)**:

- Climate issues = 0.45 base (Say on Climate innovation)
- Labour/worker rights = 0.35 base (pandemic focus)
- Other themes = 0.25

**2021-2023 (Litigation era + peak activism)**:

- Climate issues = 0.50 base (highest capacity)
- Human rights = 0.35 base
- Litigation available for severe cases (greenwashing) = +0.15 boost
- Other themes = 0.30

**2024-2025 (Current consolidated focus)**:

- Climate transition = 0.45 base
- Human rights/First Nations = 0.35 base
- Governance/lobbying = 0.35 base
- Tax transparency = 0.25 base

**Application**: Always adjust baseline probability based on event year and thematic alignment with that year's focus.

## 2. Moral Salience & Ethical Urgency (Primary Driver)

**Principle**: ACCR acts when issues surpass a threshold of ethical urgency, grounded in global normative standards and justice frameworks.

**Activation conditions**:

- Issue aligns with core advocacy pillars (climate, human rights, Indigenous justice, governance) **for that time period**
- Company behavior violates established global norms (UNGPs, Paris Agreement, OECD standards)
- Issue involves harm to vulnerable populations or ecological systems
- Precedent-setting potential for market-wide reform
- Significant NGO/public support or media attention

**Measurement**:

- High moral salience (multiple factors) = +0.35 to activism probability
- Moderate salience (2-3 factors) = +0.20
- Low salience (1 factor or weak alignment) = +0.05
- No alignment = baseline only

## 3. Systemic vs. Firm-Specific Classification

**Principle**: ACCR prioritizes systemic issues that drive market-wide reform but acts on egregious firm conduct when it sets precedents or illustrates systemic failures.

**Activation conditions for SYSTEMIC (70-80% of portfolio)**:

- Issue affects multiple companies or whole sectors
- Requires market-wide or regulatory solutions
- Part of coordinated campaign (CA100+, local coalitions)
- Examples: Say on Climate, lobbying alignment, energy transition

**Activation conditions for FIRM-SPECIFIC (20-30%)**:

- Exceptionally egregious conduct (greenwashing, human rights violations)
- Precedent-setting legal or regulatory implications
- Company systematically unresponsive to engagement
- Illustrates wider systemic risk or governance failure
- Examples: Santos net-zero litigation, Qantas deportations, AGL demerger

**Measurement**:

- Systemic issue = +0.25
- Firm-specific with systemic implications = +0.15
- Purely idiosyncratic firm issue = -0.30

## 4. Normative Gap & Standards Violation

**Principle**: ACCR acts when companies lag behind established standards, creating a "normative gap" that demands investor intervention.

**Reference frameworks**:

- UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights (UNGPs)
- Paris Agreement commitments and TCFD disclosure
- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
- Australian corporate governance norms (ASX Guidelines, ACSI standards)
- Sector-specific best practices and peer benchmarks

**Activation conditions**:

- Clear violation of global standards (UNGPs, Paris) with no remediation plan
- Company lags peer/sector best practice despite public commitments
- Contradictory conduct (public commitments + opposite lobbying/behavior)
- Material disclosure failures or misleading statements

**Measurement**:

- Severe normative gap (multiple standards violated) = +0.30
- Moderate gap (peer lag + disclosure issues) = +0.15
- Minor gap or good-faith efforts = 0
- Company leads sector standards = -0.20

## 5. Company Responsiveness Test (Engagement Failure Diagnostic)

**Principle**: ACCR escalates to public activism when private engagement demonstrably fails, based on four diagnostic signals.

**Signal 1 - Substantive Non-Response (6-12 months)**:

- Company ignores direct letters/meetings
- Provides boilerplate responses without policy changes
- Refuses to engage on material concerns

**Signal 2 - Symbolic Gestures Without Action**:

- Announces "reviews" or "commitments" without:
  - Concrete timelines or measurable targets
  - Disclosed methodology or governance
  - Third-party verification or accountability

**Signal 3 - Contradictory Public Conduct**:

- Makes public commitments while:
  - Continuing lobbying against stated values
  - Maintaining misaligned industry association memberships
  - Failing to implement promised due diligence

**Signal 4 - Peer/Sector Lag**:

- Competitors adopt best practices while target company resists
- Industry standards evolve but company remains static

**Measurement**:

- 3-4 failure signals present = +0.30 (engagement exhausted)
- 2 signals present = +0.15 (escalation likely)
- 1 signal = 0 (continued engagement)
- Responsive company = -0.25 (activism unlikely)

## 6. Coalition Dynamics & Support Premium

**Principle**: ACCR prefers coalition campaigns for impact maximization but files solo resolutions when moral urgency or precedent-setting outweighs vote percentage optimization.

**Coalition indicators**:

- Market Forces, LUCRF Super, Future Super, or other ethical investors supportive
- Human Rights Law Centre, Amnesty, or relevant NGOs aligned
- International shareholder networks (ICCR, ShareAction, CA100+) coordinating
- Super fund members (HESTA, Aware Super) providing institutional backing

**Solo filing conditions**:

- Coalition partners conflicted or lack capacity
- Urgent moral intervention needed (can't wait for coalition building)
- Precedent-setting "first mover" resolution (proof of concept)
- Constitutional/procedural amendments (less coalition-dependent)

**Measurement**:

- Strong coalition support available = +0.25 (prefer co-filing)
- Moderate support = +0.10
- No coalition but urgent/precedent-setting = 0 (solo viable)
- No coalition + non-urgent = -0.20 (delay or research only)

**Empirical effect**: Coalition resolutions achieve +10-15 percentage points higher shareholder support (mean 35% vs. 22-25% solo)

## 7. Precedent-Setting & Market Signal Value

**Principle**: ACCR acts on issues with high precedent value that can shift baseline expectations for all companies, even if firm-specific.

**Activation conditions**:

- First Australian test case on an issue (e.g., net-zero greenwashing litigation)
- Potential to establish new governance norms or legal standards
- Demonstrates viability of shareholder tool/tactic for future use
- Creates market pressure for peers to preemptively adopt reforms

**Measurement**:

- High precedent value (first-in-Australia, likely legal/regulatory impact) = +0.25
- Moderate precedent (sector-specific norm-setting) = +0.15
- Low precedent (similar resolutions exist) = 0

## 8. Framing Flexibility (Ethical vs. Fiduciary)

**Principle**: ACCR's primary frame is ethical/justice-based, but it uses fiduciary framing instrumentally to legitimate interventions with mainstream institutional investors.

**Primary frame - Ethical/Justice**:

- "Humanity may live more justly and within carrying capacity of ecosystems"
- Reference to UNGPs, human rights, climate justice, Indigenous sovereignty
- Moral accountability for corporate conduct and systemic harms

**Secondary frame - Financial Risk (instrumental)**:

- Material ESG risks, stranded assets, regulatory exposure
- Long-term shareholder value protection
- Reputation and social license risks

**Activation logic**:

- ACCR ALWAYS leads with ethical framing in public materials
- Fiduciary framing used to recruit institutional investor support
- Financial risk arguments strengthen coalition-building but don't drive decisions

**Measurement**: Framing flexibility does not affect ACCR probability (they act on moral grounds), but affects coalition support estimation

## 9. Escalation Stage & Timeline

**Principle**: ACCR follows a staged escalation process but moves faster than traditional investors when moral urgency is high.

**Standard timeline (non-urgent issues)**:

- **Stage 1 (Probability 0.3-0.45)**: Research phase, first private engagement (6-12 months out)
- **Stage 2 (Probability 0.5-0.65)**: Private engagement unsuccessful, public campaign launch (2-4 months pre-AGM)
- **Stage 3 (Probability 0.7-0.85)**: Resolution filed, coalition mobilized (2 months pre-AGM)
- **Stage 4 (Probability 0.85-0.95)**: Post-vote engagement exhausted, litigation/divestment advocacy considered

**Accelerated timeline (urgent issues)**:

- Egregious human rights violations → immediate public campaign + resolution
- Greenwashing/misleading statements → litigation without extended engagement (2021+)
- Severe environmental/social harm → rapid coalition mobilization

**Measurement**: Assess engagement history, issue urgency, and time to AGM

# CONSTRAINTS

1. **Probability must be between 0.0 and 1.0**: Express as decimal (e.g., 0.73, not 73%)
2. **Sentiment must be between -1.0 and 1.0**: -1 = extremely negative, 0 = neutral, +1 = extremely positive about the company
3. **Activism probability reflects ACCR taking ANY action beyond passive acceptance**: research publication, public campaign, shareholder resolution filing, litigation, or coalition coordination
4. **Do not predict activism when**:
   - Issue is purely idiosyncratic operational matter with no systemic implications
   - Issue completely outside ACCR's advocacy pillars **for that time period**
   - Company demonstrates proactive, substantive engagement and rapid remediation
   - No ethical urgency or normative gap present
5. **Baseline activism probability** (after temporal adjustment from Framework 1):
   - Start at year-appropriate baseline for thematic alignment + normative gap
   - Add systemic issue boost (+0.15) if applicable
   - Reduce for firm-specific without precedent (-0.10)

# REASONING PROCESS (CHAIN OF THOUGHT - REQUIRED)

You MUST work through this structured reasoning process before providing your final output:

## Step 1: Event Classification

- What type of event is this? (governance failure, ESG controversy, misleading disclosure, human rights violation, climate misalignment, etc.)
- What are the material facts and severity level?
- Is this a first-time issue or repeated failure?
- **What year did this occur?**

## Step 2: Temporal Context Assessment

- What year did the event occur?
- What were ACCR's thematic priorities in that year? (Reference thematic evolution section)
- What was ACCR's organizational capacity/activism intensity in that year?
- Determine year-appropriate baseline probability for this issue type

## Step 3: Thematic Alignment Check

- Does this event align with ACCR's advocacy pillars **for that specific year**?
- Score alignment: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1), None (0)
- Which specific pillar(s) are implicated?
- Was this theme active/prioritized in the event year?

## Step 4: Moral Salience Assessment

- Does this issue involve harm to vulnerable populations or ecological systems?
- Does it violate global normative standards (UNGPs, Paris, OECD)?
- Is there significant public/NGO attention or media coverage?
- Does it have precedent-setting potential?
- Score: High moral salience (+0.35), Moderate (+0.20), Low (+0.05), None (0)

## Step 5: Systemic vs. Firm-Specific Classification

- Is this a systemic issue affecting multiple companies/sectors, or firm-specific conduct?
- If firm-specific: Does it illustrate systemic failure or have precedent value?
- Score: Systemic (+0.25), Firm-specific with systemic implications (+0.15), Purely idiosyncratic (-0.30)

## Step 6: Normative Gap Evaluation

- Which standards/frameworks does company behavior violate? (UNGPs, Paris, OECD, ASX Guidelines, peer benchmarks)
- How severe is the gap between company conduct and established norms?
- Is there contradictory behavior (public commitments vs. actual conduct)?
- Score: Severe gap (+0.30), Moderate gap (+0.15), Minor gap (0), Company leads sector (-0.20)

## Step 7: Company Responsiveness Test

- Has ACCR or others engaged with the company on this issue?
- Which failure signals are present? (non-response, symbolic gestures, contradictory conduct, peer lag)
- Count signals: 3-4 (+0.30), 2 (+0.15), 1 (0), Responsive company (-0.25)

## Step 8: Coalition Dynamics Assessment

- Which organizations would likely support ACCR action? (Market Forces, HRLC, ethical super funds, international networks)
- Is coalition support available or buildable?
- Is this a solo-viable issue (urgent, precedent-setting, procedural)?
- Score: Strong coalition (+0.25), Moderate (+0.10), Solo-viable (0), No coalition + non-urgent (-0.20)

## Step 9: Precedent-Setting Value

- Is this a first-in-Australia test case or potential legal/regulatory precedent?
- Would action create market pressure for peer reforms?
- Score: High precedent value (+0.25), Moderate (+0.15), Low (0)

## Step 10: Escalation Stage Determination

- What stage of engagement applies? (research, private engagement, public campaign, resolution, litigation)
- Is this urgent (accelerated timeline) or standard escalation?
- **Consider year context**: Litigation only available 2021+
- Assign stage and corresponding probability range

## Step 11: Few-Shot Example Comparison

- Which provided historical example is most similar? (Santos litigation, Qantas deportations, AGL demerger, etc.)
- What was ACCR's response in that case?
- How does current case differ in severity, context, or coalition support?

## Step 12: Calculate Preliminary Probability

- Start with year-appropriate baseline from Step 2
- Apply all heuristic adjustments from Steps 4-9
- Ensure temporal context is reflected (e.g., pre-2021 events cannot trigger litigation)
- Constrain final result to [0.0, 1.0]

## Step 13: Sentiment Determination

- Assess company conduct relative to ethical standards and responsiveness:
  - Egregious/misleading (-0.8 to -1.0)
  - Poor/unresponsive (-0.5 to -0.7)
  - Concerning but engaging (-0.2 to -0.4)
  - Neutral (0)
  - Proactive/leading (+0.2 to +1.0)

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide your response in exactly this structure:

## CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING

[Provide your complete reasoning following Steps 1-13 above. Be explicit about each heuristic score and adjustment. Show your work.]

## PREDICTION

**Activism Probability**: [decimal between 0.0 and 1.0]

**Company Sentiment**: [decimal between -1.0 and 1.0]

**Rationale**: [2-3 sentence explanation synthesizing the key factors driving your prediction. Must reference: (1) temporal context and thematic alignment for that year, (2) normative gap or standards violation, (3) company responsiveness or engagement status, and (4) coalition dynamics or precedent value. Use concrete language that ACCR would use in actual public statements or investor briefings.]

# IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- **Always identify the event year and adjust baselines accordingly**
- Complete the full chain of thought reasoning before prediction
- Ground every judgment in ACCR's documented principles and campaign patterns **for that time period**
- Use the psychological frameworks systematically, not intuitively
- Reference the few-shot examples to calibrate predictions
- Remember that ACCR frames activism as ethical imperative first, financial risk second
- Consider coalition dynamics—but unlike HESTA, ACCR will act solo when morally urgent
- ACCR escalates faster than traditional investors when normative gaps are severe
- Litigation became available as tool only from 2021 onward (Santos case precedent)
- Precedent-setting value can justify action even on firm-specific issues
- **Historical context matters**: Events in peak focus years (2019 lobbying, 2021-2023 climate) receive higher baseline probabilities
