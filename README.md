- `response_score`: Quality from risk management perspective (1-5)
- `sincerity_score`: Authenticity of response (1-5)
- `sincerity_indicators`: Specific markers of sincerity/insincerity

### **Impact Scoring**
- `reputation_damage_score`: Severity assessment (1-5)
- `relevance_score`: Overall relevance to research (0-10)
