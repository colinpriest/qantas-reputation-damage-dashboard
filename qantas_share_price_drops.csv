**No fatal accidents, emergency landings, or engine failures involving Qantas aircraft were reported between October 14 and October 21, 2013.** However, there was one notable safety-related incident during this period:

### Flight Planning Incident (Sydney to Perth)

- **Description:** On October 15, 2013, a Qantas Airbus A330-303 (VH-QPD) was involved in a flight planning-related incident at Sydney Airport. The flight plan was updated due to forecast fog at Perth, requiring an alternate destination. The new flight plan was not successfully communicated to the flight crew in a timely manner, leading to a procedural breakdown in pre-flight planning. No injuries or damage occurred, and the incident was classified as a ""serious incident"" by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB)[1].
- **Date:** October 15, 2013
- **Flight Number:** QF 565 (Sydney to Perth)[1]

- **Bird Strike (Dallas, USA):** A Qantas Boeing 747-400 experienced a bird strike on October 18, 2013, at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. However, this incident occurred outside the specified date range (October 14–21, 2013) and is not directly relevant to the query[3].
- **No other safety incidents** (such as emergency landings, engine failures, or accidents) involving Qantas aircraft were reported within the specified timeframe.
